# ðŸŽˆ Universal code obfuscator

### [ABOUT/BACKGROUND INFO]
This uses codestral's ai generated code, however I have noticed a ton of issues with it not returning code if prompt is longer than a few sentances, which means the code won't be as obfuscated as it can be. This can be used to start but not as a full replacement for other types of code obfuscation. Mainly tested on JS and python scripts, however it should work on all lanugages. Feel free to modify prompt as I've only had around 5ish hours to work and test them. Just keep in mind that if it gets too long the code won't return. Project for Codestral 24 HR hackathon for lablab.ai.
